    <string name="faq_question">Why does Jaltrack not work ?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer">Sometimes jaltrack does not ring at scheduled time, because of cleaner
        appsor phone system shut off jaltrack.\n\nIf you have installed cleaner apps like CM security,
        please make sure they do not stop jaltrack.\n\nSome devices such as SamSung, have strict
        power plans, the system will shut off jaltrack after locking your screen. We suggest you add
        jaltrack to the unmonitored apps list to avoid missing reminders.</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy">We have created apps with respect to user\'s privacy. Our apps
        does not collect any data or information from the phone or user. But to make apps work properly
        we sometimes request permissions for: \n\n 1) Access WIFI for showing ads inside the app\n
        2) Read external storage\n\nWith Jaltrack app: This permission is used only to access your
        phone for reminders.</string>
